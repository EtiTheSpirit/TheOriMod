**What happens?**
Describe what happens using words, images, and/or videos. Be as descriptive as you can and need to be.

**How do I cause it?**
Write down the steps to cause this bug. If it's weird or requires specific steps, explain it as if you were teaching your grandma to do it. Basically, if I can cause the bug, then it becomes much easier to fix it.

**Is this bug so bad that you find it nearly impossible to play?**
Just a simple yes or no here should be fine. This helps me to judge how important it is that I get a fix out sooner than later.

**Log file**
Go to your minecraft directory (`.minecraft`) and open the logs folder. Drag debug.log here. Make sure IT IS FROM THE LATEST RUN. This log file keeps track of everything that happened the last time you launched the game, so if you restarted it after crashing and it worked fine this time, your log will not contain helpful information!
