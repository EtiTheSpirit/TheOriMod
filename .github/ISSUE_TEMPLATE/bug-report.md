**What happens?**
Describe what happens using words, images, and/or videos. Be as descriptive as you can and need to be.

**How do I cause it?**
Write down the steps to cause this bug. If it's weird or requires specific steps, explain it as if you were teaching your grandma to do it. Basically, if I can cause the bug, then it becomes much easier to fix it.

**Is this bug so bad that you find it nearly impossible to play?**
Just a simple yes or no here should be fine. This helps me to judge how important it is that I get a fix out sooner than later.

**Log file**
Go to your minecraft directory (`.minecraft`) and open the logs folder. Drag debug.log here. REMEMBER: debug.log tells me about what happened the last time you ran the game. You need to link the file only after causing the bug you are reporting here.
