**What is the feature?**
A good feature solves a problem or fills a hole. If you can, try to consider this from the standpoint of "While using The Ori Mod, I find it too annoying to/impossible to/too confusing to..." - it's not required, but it helps.

**How important is this feature to you?**
Just a brief description of how important you think this feature is. You just spitballing, or is this the kind of thing that makes or breaks a key mechanic of the mod? Leave this empty or erase it if you don't feel like filling it out, not a big deal.
