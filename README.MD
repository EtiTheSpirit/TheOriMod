# The Ori Mod

The Ori Mod aims to append content from or inspired by the *Ori* game franchise. It is maintained and developed by [Xan/Eti](https://etithespir.it/) and aims to interact well with other mods in its field.

# API & Development Alongside This Mod
Are you a modder? The Ori mod comes with a separate API component that allows you to change how your own mod's objects interact with Spirits and other Spirit-esque equipment and entities! It is fully documented. You can find the docs [on my website](https://etithespir.it/OriModAPIDocs/etithespirit/orimod/api/package-summary.html)!
