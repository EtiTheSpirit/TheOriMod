# Eti's Mod // The Ori Mod

An early alpha test of *The Ori Mod*, which appends mechanics from the *Ori* game franchise to Minecraft. It is mostly used in the official Discord server for the franchise.

The document here is not yet complete as far as information goes, mostly because the mod isn't really ready.

# For Developers

There is an API, but it only exists for a version that hasn't even been released yet. It will be documented once released.
