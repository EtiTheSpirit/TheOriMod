# Eti's Mod // The Ori Mod

An early alpha test of *The Ori Mod*, which appends mechanics from the *Ori* game franchise to Minecraft. It is mostly used in the official Discord server for the franchise.

The document here is not yet complete as far as information goes.

# For Developers

There is no EtiMod API in the traditional sense. Rather, IMC is used extensively for this purpose. IMC is documented on the mod's wiki.

## Spirits Have Hooves, and Hooves Make Special Sounds
If you need to integrate your mod so that custom block sounds are appended when walked on by Spirits (out of the wide selection I have), you can use IMC to do so. Right now, this is documented on the mod's wiki. [check this page](https://the-ori-minecraft-mod.fandom.com/wiki/IMC_Methods) for more information on that.
