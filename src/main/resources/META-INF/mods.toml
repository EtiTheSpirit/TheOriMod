§lForge Discord Mention Honorarium:§r

- §cMcJty§r - You have the patience of a saint. Genuinely speechless.
- §cRobotGryphon§r - Made Compact Machines, where I sourced instrumental debug render code from.
- §bSizableShrimp§r - Made some helpful stuff for Gradle that enables better tooling for the mod.
- §bgigaherz§r - Made GraphLib, which, while unused, was very helpful in figuring out Light tech.
